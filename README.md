git-ec
======

git-ec aka "Git Easy Commit" is a simple terminal tool for selecting and committing multiple files (new, modified, unstaged).
It calls system git commands (status, add, commit). 

#### Default keymap
`<up>``k`navigate up<br>
`<down>``j` navigate down<br>
`<page up>` navigate page up<br>
`<page down>` navigate page down<br>
`<space>` select / deselect file<br>
`c` commit selected files<br>
`<esc>``q` quit<br>

## Important notes

git-cc is still in the development phase (ugly looks & code, memory leaks, no real error handling) - use it at your own risk.<br>

#### Development

Feel free to improve the messy code and add missing features (there are `//TODO` comments).<br>
You can find the latest code on `development` branch.
